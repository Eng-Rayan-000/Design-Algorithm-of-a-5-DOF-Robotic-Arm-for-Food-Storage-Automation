# Design Algorithm  of a 5-DOF Robotic Arm for Food Storage Automation




---

##  Execution Algorithm

The robotic arm executes tasks based on the following sequential workflow:

### 1. Warehouse Mapping and Initialization
- Digitally map all shelves, bins, and zones within the warehouse.
- Assign unique IDs and coordinates to each storage slot.

### 2. Object Detection and Localization
- Use 3D vision systems (RGB-D or LiDAR) to identify item locations.
- Align detected items with digital map data.

### 3. Task Reception
- Receive pick-and-place instructions from the Warehouse Management System (WMS).
- Validate item availability and destination location.

### 4. Path Planning and Motion Execution
- Use algorithms like **A\*** or **RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree)** to compute optimized paths.
- Dynamically avoid static and moving obstacles.

### 5. Grasping and Item Handling
- Navigate to the item location.
- Activate the gripper (vacuum or mechanical) to pick the item.
- Confirm grip using force sensors.

### 6. Item Placement
- Move to the target drop-off location.
- Place item accurately in the assigned storage area.

### 7. Reset and Repeat
- Return to a neutral position and wait for the next command.

### 8. Error Handling
- Detect and log errors (e.g., missed grip, misplacement).
- Retry task or alert the control system as needed.
